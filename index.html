<h6>
  Why We Love C?
</h6>

<p>To understand what's **really** happening under the hood, and to be in absolute control in your programming!  (Do not trust abstracted languages!)  How the C standard implements ideas, is how the Linux computer and Internet servers as-a-whole get implemented. (..And Android phones, and Chrome Books, and Raspberry Pi, and others.)  Being just a step above Assembly, it is expressive as a high level language, while having the ability to be in touch with the hardware.  C is the common starting point for engineers developing new systems.  You'll find that most other languages are just built from C.  (Therefore, do not trust a person who says it cannot be done in C!)  Micro-managing code to optimize algorithms makes C binaries the fastest *practical* processes [<a href="https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/which-programs-are-fastest.html">link</a>].  The real power is only for those with the faculties to master its domain, as you are responsible for the binary you produce; the training wheels are off, and there is no safety net!  (Not true anymore, the OS has many built-in fail-safes.)  If you can C, everything else is cheese.  Unlike other languages, C is the veteran in the room that has seen it all.  There are no cutting corners in C, and it's a minimal tool set.  It is the master language.  It demands thoroughness.  Use it wisely. </p>

<h2>Who We Are </h2>

<p>
We are <em>amateurs</em> and fanatic about details; fascinated to know what's <em>really</em> happening under the hood and to be in absolute control in our programming.  Why accept limitations?  (Do not trust abstracted languages!)

<h2>Why Love C </h2>

<p>
C is <em>lingua franca</em>.  The Godfather.  There are no "there's no library for that yet" excuses.  You will find that most language runtimes are merely built atop C, waiting for capabilities to be written in C.  <em>What-a-shit-show</em>.  (Pity the fool who says it cannot be done in C!)  C is the go-to <em>foundation</em> for real engineers developing new technology, making it ubiquitous within the tools one uses today.
How the C runtime implements ideas is how UNIX &ndash;and consequently, POSIX&ndash; systems as-a-whole get implemented (Internet servers, financial systems, all mobile devices, many more!)  The two technologies were developed in tandom and have been in bed together ever since.  Competing languages will try to compare, but C is the veteran in the room that has done it all.
Micro-managing code to optimize algorithms makes C binaries the fastest practical processes [<a href="https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/which-programs-are-fastest.html">benchmarks</a>].  Being just a step above Assembly, it is expressive as a high level language, while having the ability to cater to the hardware.  The real power goes to those with the faculties to master its domain, as one is made responsible for the binary they produce.  The training wheels are off and there is no safety net!  (Not true anymore, the OS has many built-in fail-safes.)  There are no cutting corners, it demands thoroughness.  Use it wisely.  The first principle in the "spirit of C" is to <em>trust the programmer</em>.

<h2>The Down Low </h2>

<h3>What distinguishes C? </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Manual memory management </li>
	<li>No garbage collection </li>
	<li>Minimal tools built-in; streamlined </li>
	<li>Not portable (despite early claims compared to Assembly upon inception) </li>
	<li>Is <em>in fact</em> a high level language
	<li>Often <em>is</em> the runtime system </li>
</ul>


<h3>The Contenders</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>C++</em> is its own beast.  Originally as a superset to C for OOP extensions, it has deviated from C, though ANSI-C code will still compile on a C++ compiler.  C++ is very suitable for large projects with its OOP design.  It does, however, suffer from identidy insecurities because it is always trying to stance-up against C for some reason. </li>
  <li><em>Objective-C</em> is a direct superset of C adopted by Apple for their products, now superceded by Swift.  C code will always compile on Objective-C.  Learn C, and Objective-C will be a breeze.  </li>
  <li><em>C# (C-Sharp)</em> has a similar relation to C as C++, and is developed by Microsoft for their products.  It mostly compiles to Common Intermediate Language (CIL) for a Common Language Infrastructure/Runtime (CLI, CLR).  C compiles to machine code. C# is also the scripting language for the Unity game engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Extra: Both Microsoft and Apple kernels are originally -and still contain- C code.
</p>


<h3>When and how to C </h3>

<blockquote>
"C should not be your first rodeo."
</blockquote>
<cite>&mdash;Motherduck</cite>

<p>
The distinguishing factors of C make it appropriate for projects with low level considerations of systems, and reduntant otherwise.  If one is not going to enjoy venturing into the abyss of systems, there are perfectly suited languages for that purpose of which to spend one's time.  Do not let tutorials cop-out and convince oneself that C is just syntax like most other languages.  Writing robust battle-ready code for production and showcasing is going to require a broader understanding of the toolchain than just that of the C language itself.  Require a compatibility layer like Cygwin/MinGW is the antithesis of being a C programmer.  This is where the programmers are distinguished from the script-kiddies.
</p><p>
Reading a C-standard textbook from cover to index will fill one's head with un-applicable knowledge.  Unbuffered keyboard input from the user is not acquired through the C language alone, never mind audio/visual and device communications.  (And static programs won't get one laid.)  Once one breaks those barriers the code will &ndash;initially&ndash; only be valid within the environment of which it was produced.  Fuck.
</p><p>
Start with the preprocessor and the linker&mdash;learn the toolchain!  It's unsexy but there's no point in learning C if one is not going to master its domain.  To master a domain, one must work from the ground&ndash;up.  Learn the preprocessor and the linker, be a programmer!
</p>
